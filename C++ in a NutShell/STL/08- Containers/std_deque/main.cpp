// std::deque:
// - Note that deque is pretty much like vector but differs in simple properties.
// - It has dynamic size handled automatically, can expand or contract as needed.
// - Elements are NOT stored in contiguous memory.
// - Direct memory access.
// - Rapid insertion and deletion at the front and back (constant time).
// - All iterators are available and may invalidate.

// - For more info:
